# Approach

1. Download the file and use `exiftool` to check the information.
2. I just kept opening the file and got directories with descending numbers from 1000.tar, 999.tar, 998.tar...
3. This was proof that we need to extract the file 1000 times in a loop.
4. I couldn't make a code that extracted a .tar file, so found this particular code from this creator 
# Notes

1. Use `tesseract` to get the flag in another file, as this image had a big enough text for `tesseract` to recognise the text.
