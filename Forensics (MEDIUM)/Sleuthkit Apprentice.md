# Approach

1. Download the gile, `gunzip` the file. Found another disk image and decided to use `autopsy`.
2. Found the `/3/` directory, which in many cases holds the flag for such challenges.
3. After dome digging, I found the flag inside an edited text folder.
4. Fortunately only random characters were added in between the spaces of each letter of the flag, hence I could just copy the flag and manually remove the added characters.

5. The flag for the challenge is  :  `picoCTF{by73_5urf3r_3497ae6b}`
