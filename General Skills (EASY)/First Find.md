# Approach

1. Download the file and extraact it, while it's extrating you will see all the extracted files shown as display.

2. The image already shows us the location to the `uber-secret.txt` file, so just `cd` to the location and `cat` the flag.
3. The flag is : `picoCTF{f1nd_15_f457_ab443fd1}`
