# Approach

1. Download both the files from the challenge. One is a "little endian" file named static and the other a shell script code.
2. After opening the script, we understand that we need to input the "static" file to the script and it will decode it into a flag.
3. I changed the static file into "static.txt" and input it inside the script to execute the code.
4. Surprisingly, it didn't work and gave an error.
5. I `cat` out the static.txt to find out that the flag was there inside the whole time, there was no need to use the script in the first place.
