# Approach

1. Download all the three files from the challenge.
2. The goal is to get the flag using the python script, the file and the password.
3. I used the following command to run the python file :

  ```bash
  python ende.py -d flag.txt.en
  ```

4. Use the password from the pw.txt file and get the flag.
