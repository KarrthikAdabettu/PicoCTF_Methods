# Approach

1. Use the netcat command from the challenge, copy it and paste it on the terminal.
2. You get a bunch of numbers, which we know is ASCII encoded from the challenge hints.
3. Copy paste the numbers onto an online ASCII decoder tool, then we get the flag : `picoCTF{g00d_k1tty!_n1c3_k1tty!_3d84edc8}`


# Notes

We can make and use a custom python looping script to decode every number, but that takes time hence using an online tool.
