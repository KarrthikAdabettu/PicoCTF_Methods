# Approach

1. Download the challenge file and unzip it.
2. While extracting, you will see the start and end of the directory files, in this case the end directory is `heads`

3. `cd` to that directory and `cat` the master file. You will find the flag.

4. The flag is :  `picoCTF{t1m3m@ch1n3_e8c98b3a}`


# Notes

1. Try to learn commands on git.
